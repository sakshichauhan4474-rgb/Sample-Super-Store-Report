# Sample-Super-Store-Report
Just finished an interactive Superstore Report in Power BI! Focused on clarity, usability, and actionable insightsâ€”like identifying top-performing regions and spotting tight margins. Gained hands-on experience with DAX, slicers, tooltips, and layout design. A great step forward in my data analytics journey!
